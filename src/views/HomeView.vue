    <h1>About Hiyoko</h1>
    <p>
      Beginner Japanese learners have trouble bridging the gap between early
      studies (Duolingo) and intermediate proficiency. 
    </p>

    <br/>
    
    <p>
      For self-studiers the common method is through immersion learning, but I believe 
      that newcomers are intimidated by this approach due to its unstructured nature. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Hiyoko aims to be a application that helps begineers cross over into the
      intermediate level, allowing them to engage with native content.
