    <p>
      Beginner Japanese learners have trouble bridging the gap between early
      studies (Duolingo) and intermediate proficiency. For self-studiers the
      common method is through immersion learning but I believe that newcomers
      are intimidated by this approach due to its unstructured nature. Hiyoko
      aims to be a application that helps begineers cross over into the
      intermediate level, allowing them to engage with native content.
